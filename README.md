# ZtestAssisted
This is a GUI version of my Zchrom CLI app.  It is a program to test what would happen if we added a Z chromosome that made a person Female, regardless of their other chromosome. ex: a ZY Female

While the CLI app is complete, I always wanted to see if I could make a GUI version.  Unfortunately, I never had the time to learn how.  But now, using copilot, I was able to put together a GUI in an afternoon.

The CLI version is 100% AI free.  The GUI version is significantly AI assisted, at least for the GUI elements.  That’s why I’m treating them like different apps all together.  If you want to use non-AI code, stick with the CLI.

Known issues:
This does not have the option of starting with a random population, but I never found that option produced interesting results, so I don’t really care enough to put it back in.

This time, running this code is a bit more complicated than the CLI, because of the fyne code I used for the GUI.  You’ll need a number of development libraries to get this working, but it shouldn’t be too hard to figure out.
